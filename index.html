    <p class="card-text"><br>This webapp allows for the user to dynamically add and edit courses via a webpage, and sends those changes back to a database to persist the data.
        This was my first ever fullstack application. I coded everything from the database, to the RESTful APIs all the way to the front end using reactstrap. I am super proud of this, and really loved putting the all of the very different parts together to work as one cohesive unit.
    The database was written in postgreSQL and used flask to route the APIs appropriately. Reactstrap was used to have dynamic behavior that
    rerenders the page automatically upon changes without needing to refresh everything. The Bootstrap component of Reactstrap also helped with the convenient tables and other preset components for styling.

        <img src = "./tweetPicture.PNG" alt = "no" width = "100%" height = "400">
    <p class="card-text"><br>This was a bit of a passion project of mine. The idea was to have a twitter account that anyone could tweet from anonymously without them having the account credentials.
        After investigating Twitter's APIs I signed up for their developer's program to get started. I had already knew how to use flask,
        so I used that to handle the processing of the tweet, and used the Tweepy library to access the API.
        I also decided to make a basic word filter to prevent curse words from being tweeted.<br>

        <img src = "./checkersPicture.PNG" alt = "no" width = "75%" height = "500">
    <p class="card-text"><br>This was my first experience ever working on a project with a group of other people. Although it had its challenges, the lessons I learned were invaluable.
    The goal for this project was code the backend for a checkers webapp. This was also my first time working on a webapp. We used Apache Spark to route the various http methods.
        While it sounds fairly simple, the project was harder than we first expected. We had a sign-in system and let players choose their opponents from the player lobby. We also implemented a bot to be available to play, along with a help button to suggest a move if the player would like.
        This project was really fun and I learned alot, especially about working things out with a team, and working around other's schedules and capabilities.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Library Book Management System</h5>
        <img src = "./LBMSPicture.PNG" alt = "no" width = "100%" height = "350">
    <p class="card-text"><br>I was in an group with 3 other amazing people for this project. We had been given a set of requirements for a fictional library management system. The design was 100% up to us, and we also had to implement our design to prove that it worked.
    The class we were in was all about using software patterns and different subsystems to design robust systems that can run dynamically and are also easy to maintain.
        This was done completely in Java, so all of the group was familiar with the technologies we were using. What was really challenging was weighing all of our options as to how to
        best design the system. The application was originally run through the console, but had to add a GUI for our second release.
        Thankfully, our system design had made it easy to run GUI input through our program without making any major changes. We received an A on this project and were praised for our elegant design by our professor.
